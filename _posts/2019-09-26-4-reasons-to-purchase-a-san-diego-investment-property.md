<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’ve been thinking of investing in the San Diego real estate market, today’s message is for you.</em></p>

Investing in San Diego real estate is a fantastic way to build wealth, and there are four reasons why you should consider pursuing this opportunity:

**1\. The local housing market is still a bargain.** Homes in our area remain relatively affordable, and properties have continued to appreciate over time. Those who purchased a $500,000 home five years ago, for example, have most likely seen that property’s value grow to about $650,000.&nbsp;

**2\. Home prices are still good.** As I mentioned in the last point, buyers have retained a great deal of purchasing power with list prices remaining fairly low. Sellers these days are extremely motivated, which has allowed me, personally, to negotiate some great deals on investment properties. You could very well do the same.&nbsp;

**3\. The rental market is amazing.** One of the best ways to generate cash flow from an investment property is by renting it out, and the San Diego rental market is absolutely thriving. Even in less sought-after neighborhoods, you can rent out a 3-bed, 1-bath home and still get $2,500 or so in rent. And, with an average mortgage of $2,000 per month, this gives you a positive cash flow of $500.&nbsp;

**4\. There is a large population of renters in San Diego.** Between students from the many nearby colleges and the high volume of people moving in from out of state, there is never a shortage of renters in our city.&nbsp;

After taking all these points into account, you may be thinking, “This sounds great, but how do I get started?” Well, real estate investing is simpler to dive into than most think. Let’s go over a few steps you’ll need to take.

First, you’ll need a 20% down payment to buy an investment property. If you happen to already have that kind of cash on-hand through your savings account, you’re in a good place to start. However, if you don’t have enough already saved up, you still have some options. Interest rates are incredibly low right now, which means it’s a great time to pull equity out of your own home and apply it toward a down payment on an investment.&nbsp;

Or, if you’re thinking of moving to a new home soon anyway, another great option is to simply turn your current home into an investment property instead of selling it. Unlike the purchase of a new investment property, you can purchase your next primary residence for as little as 3% down.

Hopefully this has given you a better understanding into why (and how) to invest in our San Diego real estate market.
