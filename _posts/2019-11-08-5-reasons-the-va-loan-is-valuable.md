*Here are five reasons why any U.S. service member should use the VA loan program.*

Today I’m sharing my five reasons why the VA loan is one of the most valuable, if not the most valuable loan program available to current military service members and veterans:

**1\. There is no down payment needed.** The VA loan allows you to purchase real estate for as little as zero down. If you were to use virtually any other loan program out there, you would have to save up a significant amount of cash to set aside for the down payment.&nbsp;

**2\. There are many eligible properties.** You can use this loan for a detached single-family home, a condo, a townhome, or even a two- to four-unit investment property as long as you live in one of the units for at least a year.

**3\. They carry low interest rates.** Interest rates for VA loans are commonly the most competitive rates available of any loan program, even with a decent credit score. A borrower can generally get a lower rate than with an FHA or conventional loan.&nbsp;

**4\. There is no monthly mortgage insurance.** There is no such thing as mortgage insurance with the VA loan. With other low down payment programs out there for the general public, mortgage insurance is a required monthly premium owed by the borrower, which often eats up hundreds of dollars a month.&nbsp;

**5\. You can reuse the VA loan for the rest of your life.** Reuse the 100% financing more than once. For as long as you make your payments on time, you can sell your home and reuse the VA loan again and again to purchase your next property.

If you served in the military you’re missing out if you aren’t using the VA loan. I’ve assisted hundreds of families to purchase their dream home, and I would love to help you out as well.&nbsp;
