<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re looking for a more affordable way to buy a home, one of these four loan programs may be right for you.</em></p>

If you’ve been thinking of purchasing a home but fear that you don’t have enough money for a down payment, I’ve got good news: You’re probably closer to achieving your homeownership dreams than you think.

Despite what conventional wisdom says, you don’t actually need 20% down to buy a home. There are several programs that allow you to put down much less than this. Certain loans even allow qualifying homebuyers to buy a home with nothing down at all. Here are four of the most popular:&nbsp;

**1\. FHA loan program.** This is the most popular of these four options, and for good reason. It requires homebuyers to put just 3.5% down while allowing for a considerably lower interest rate than what you could secure with a conventional loan. Better yet, applicants only need a credit score of 580 or greater to qualify.&nbsp;

**2\. VA loan program.** This program allows United States veterans to buy a home with no money down, no monthly mortgage insurance, and at a considerably lower interest rate compared to what’s possible with conventional loans. This loan program also lacks a minimum credit score requirement.

**3\. Conventional 97.** This loan, which requires just 3% down, has a credit score minimum of 620 and carries slightly higher interest rates than the other loans we’ve listed, but it is still a popular option.&nbsp;

**4\. Down payment assistance program.** If money is an issue for you, this may be the perfect option. The income limit will depend on the home’s size and location, but it's usually at or below $120,000. Perhaps the greatest draw to this program is that it allows those who qualify to buy a home with as little as 1% down.

Hopefully, you’ve found value in this message. However, before you proceed with any of these programs, make sure you speak to your lender to see what they recommend. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
