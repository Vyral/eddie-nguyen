There are a few key benefits of getting pre-approved for a home loan. Learn more here.

It’s important to understand that when a seller accepts your offer, you are asking them to remove their property from the market as an active listing while you meet your contingency dates. Therefore, **the stronger the financial evidence that you include with your offer, the more likely the seller will accept your offer over other prospective buyers.** Your proof of funds will help the seller believe and trust that your pre-qualification is evidence that you’re a serious consumer who poses minimal risk to them.

What’s the difference between pre-qualification and underwriting? If you’re a buyer applying for a mortgage, **never assume that you are truly and correctly involved in that process without having your lender outline the steps that must complete.** Understand that a pre-approval letter is a quick and shallow look at your financial ability to perform—it doesn’t mean that a full underwriting process has occurred.

During the full underwriting process, a potential buyer is vetted through a thorough examination of personal financial documents such as tax returns and bank statements. The borrower may even receive a loan commitment with final, approved conditions attached.

It’s also critical to understand the timeframe within which the process will be completed in order to finance contingency dates as are outlined in the purchase agreement.

When it comes to paying cash for a property, you may feel reluctant to share your bank statements, and rightfully so. Therefore, **we suggest an alternative: Request a letter from the financial institution that has the funds secured.** Such a letter, written on the letterhead of the financial institution, may very well be your greatest advantage when it comes to securing a contract versus other, less competitive bids.
