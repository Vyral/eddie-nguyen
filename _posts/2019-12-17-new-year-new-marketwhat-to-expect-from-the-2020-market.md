What can we expect from the housing market come 2020?

Well, experts predict that the housing market will heat up in the new year. Low mortgage rates continue to invigorate the buyer’s market. With the increase in buyer activity, inventory will remain low in the first half of the year.

This means that homebuyers will have fewer properties to choose from than they’ve had in the past five years. However, **the return of biddings wars will be great news for sellers**, who may be holding out this year as the market stabilizes.

**Zillow and Redfin expect that about one in every four offers will face a bidding war in 2020**, compared to only one in 10 for 2019. This increase in competition will likely push annual price growth in the first half of the year to around 6%, compared to 2% in 2019. Increased competition and faster price growth will tempt more homeowners and builders to list their homes, which will help balance out the supply and demand by the end of the year.

So what does this all mean?

For sellers, **it means that now is the time to list your home and buy another in the area you’ve been wanting to move to.** By acting now, you won’t have to compromise on how and where you want to live. Interest rates are really low, meaning you’re in the driver’s seat and can do things on your own terms. At the very least, explore your options—you may be surprised at how great yours look in the coming year.
